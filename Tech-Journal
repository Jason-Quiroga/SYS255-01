I. File Permissions
  A1. Important commands
    1. "ls -ld /<directory>/" --> lists file permissions for the directory
    2. "ls -l /<directory>/" --> Lists files in the directory
    3. "su - <name>" --> If done as root, will allow you to login to the user without needing a password
    4. "exit" --> Logs you out of the user
    5. "id" --> If done as a user, lets you know what groups you're in
    6. "chown <user> <file path>" --> changes the owner of a file (ie. chown fred /accounting/newproduct.txt)
  A. Make sure you're logged on to wsk01 and ssh into dhcp-01
  B. To Add a User
    1. Get into root (sudo -i)
    2. Type "useradd <name>" (ie. useradd bob)
    3. Type "passwd <name>" then enter the password when prompted
  C. If you type "ls -ld /home/<name>", it will tell you what is in the directory.
    1. It will also tell you at the beginning their file permissions "drwx------ <owner> <group associated>".
      a. D --> Directory, because the name is a directory technically (it's the file type, so if it's not a directory it could have a "-")
      b. R --> Read; the user can read files
      c. W --> Write; The user can write to files
      d. X --> Execute; The user can go into the directory and view its contents IF DIRECTORY, anything else is the user can run the file.
      e. The next three dashes are the GROUP permissions to this file (directory). When a user is created, a group of their name is created and they
      are added to it.
      f. The last three dashes are the permissions for "Other". These are for people that are not specified in the access control list, so people who
      are not the user and not in the group.
  D. How to add a group
    1. Type "groupadd <name>" (ie. groupadd accounting)
  E. How to add users to a group
    1. "usermod -aG <group> <name>" (ie. usernmod -aG accounting alice)
  F. How to create a directory for certain permission-level groups (ie. Accounting directory)
    1. "mkdir /<directoryname>" (ie. mkdir /accounting)
    2. To view if the directory is there, you can type "ls -l /"
  G. If you are in root, you can become another user by typing "su - <name>" (ie. su - alice)
  H. You can put the output of the command you're going to run into a txt file by adding "> <filename>" to the end (ie. echo alice > alice.txt) < will put "alice" in alice.txt
  I. How to change the group of a directory
    1. Go into root and type "chgrp <group> /<directory>"
      a. ie "chgrp accounting /accounting" --> This means that you want to apply the accounting group to the accounting directory. Now users from "accounting" can do
      what the group can do in the accounting directory.
  J. How to modify what a group can do in a directory (change it so they can read/write/execute)
    1. Be in root and type "chmod g+<r/w/x> /<directory>/"
      a. ie. "chmod g+w /accounting/" --> allows for the "group" set in accounting to be able to write files to the /accounting/ directory.
      b. If you type "*" instead of a directory, then all files in the directory that you are currently in will have their permissions changed (as long as you have
      permissions to change those files, if not, those files will not be affected).
  K. How to modify the "other"s to not be able to read, write, and execute a file
    1. In root, type "chmod o-<r/w/x> /<directory>/"
      a. ie. "chmod o-rwx /accounting/" --> Makes it so all other users cannot do anything in this directory.
  L. Typing in numbers instead of letters for chmod (IN OCTAL)
    1. You can type letters in for chmod instead of "g+w" or whatever it is.
    2. To modify, you can type "chmod -v 600 alicefile.txt", which would give read and write to the owner, but nothing to anyone else.
    3. This is the case because in binary:
      a. Read     r   100   4 (bits)
      b. Write    w   010   2 (bits)
      c. Execute  x   001   1 (bits)
    4. So, for read and write, the number would be "6". If we wanted everyone to be able to read and write, we could type "666". If we want to give everyone
    permissions, we can type "777" because they all add to 7 bytes.

  E. To release your IP and obtain a new one
    1. In the console, type "ipconfig /release"
    2. Then, type "ipconfig /renew"
    3. You should now have a new IP Address if you type "ipconfig /all"

    6. Enter "default-lease-time <time in seconds>;
              max-lease-time <time in seconds>;"
    7. Press esc and type "ZZ"
    8. Restart the server "systemctl stop dhcpd", then "systemctl start dhcpd", then "systemctl status dhcpd" and make sure that the system suscessfully restarted
    9. Then, go back to the cmd on wsk01 and type "ipconfig /release", then "ipconfig /renew"
    10. Type "ipconfig /all" and make sure that the "Lease obtained" and "Lease expires" equals the amount of time you entered for your seconds.
    
  DELIVERABLE 5:
  Wireshark Packets
  Under the DHCP packets, there are Release, Discover, Offer, Request, and ACK. Release means that the user is sending a request to the DHCP server to release their current
  IP Address and cancel the lease. Discover is when the user discovers the DHCP server. Offer is when the DHCP server offers the user an IP Address in the network. Request
  is when the user accepts the IP Address and asks for the DHCP server to give it the address. ACK is when the server acknowledges the request and sets the IP Address of the
  user to that IP address officially.
